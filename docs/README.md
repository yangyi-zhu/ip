### ‚ùì FAQs
**Q:** How do I transfer data to a friend or another device of my own? <br>
**A:** Locate the directory where you stored the `.jar` file. Open `../data` and your list should be saved in a file called `tasks.txt`. Place this file in the `../data` directory on the secondary device and run the program as normal.

### üõ†Ô∏è Known Issues
By default, completed tasks are marked with a checkmark `‚úì` symbol. This is not supported by all devices, and the user might see a question mark `?` in its place.
> If this is the case, the user can fix this by forking and cloning this repository to their local device, and replacing the checkmark with another character at Line 67 in `src/main/java/baguette/datatypes/Task.java`.
